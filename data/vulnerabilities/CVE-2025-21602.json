	"description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker sending a specific BGP update packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects Junos OS:   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2; This issue does not affect versions prior to 21.1R1.Junos OS Evolved:   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.This issue does not affect versions prior to 21.1R1-EVO",
