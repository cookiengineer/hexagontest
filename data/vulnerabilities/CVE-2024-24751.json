In affected versions the existing access control check for events in the backend module got broken during the update of the extension to TYPO3 12.4, because the 'RedirectResponse' from the '$this-\u003eredirect()' function was never handled. This issue has been addressed in version 7.4.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
