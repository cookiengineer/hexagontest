	"name": "CVE-2024-10952",
	"description": "The The Authors List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via update_authors_list_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
