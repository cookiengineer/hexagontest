	"name": "CVE-2024-5751",
	"description": "BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the 'add_deployment' function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to 'os.environ'. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the '/config/update' endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the 'get_secret' function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.",
