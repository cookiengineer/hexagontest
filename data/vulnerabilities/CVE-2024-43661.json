	"description": "The \u003credacted\u003e.so library, which is used by \u003credacted\u003e, isvulnerable to a buffer overflow in the code that handles the deletionof certificates. This buffer overflow can be triggered by providing along file path to the \u003credacted\u003e action of the \u003credacted\u003e.exe CGI binary orto the \u003credacted\u003e.sh CGI script. This binary or script will write thisfile path to \u003credacted\u003e, which is thenread by \u003credacted\u003e.soThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.Likelihood: Moderate - An attacker will have to find this exploit byeither obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trialand error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)account to gain access to the \u003credacted\u003e.exe CGI binary or \u003credacted\u003e.shscript to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such accesssend an HTTP request that triggers it.Impact: High - The \u003credacted\u003e process, which we assume isresponsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing afterperforming the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflowcauses the process to segfault before\u003credacted\u003e is removed. This means that,even though \u003credacted\u003e is automatically restarted, it will crashagain as soon as it tries to parse the text file.CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack leads to reducred availability of the device (VC:N/VI:N/VA:H). THere is not impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Alltough this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not forsee a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y). Because the DoS condition is written to disk persistantly, it cannot be recovered by the user (R:I).",
