{
	"name": "CVE-2024-23820",
	"description": "OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to 'ListObjects' may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an 'out of memory' error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.",
