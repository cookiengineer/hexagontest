	"name": "CVE-2024-48931",
	"description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint 'http://\u003cZima_Server_IP:PORT\u003e/v3/file?token=\u003ctoken\u003e\u0026files=\u003cfile_path\u003e' is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the 'files' parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including '/etc/shadow', which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the 'files' parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",
