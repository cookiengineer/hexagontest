	"description": "LGSL (Live Game Server List) provides online status lists for online video games. Versions up to and including 6.2.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'Referer' HTTP header. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization. When crafted malicious input is provided in the 'Referer' header, it is echoed back into an HTML attribute in the applications response. Commit 7ecb839df9358d21f64cdbff5b2536af25a77de1 contains a patch for the issue.",
