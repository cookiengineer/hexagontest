	"name": "CVE-2024-55603",
	"description": "Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler ('app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php'), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a 'session_id' is given, kanboard queries the data from the 'sessions' sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given 'session_id' has already exceeded its lifetime ('expires_at').Thus, a session which's lifetime is already '\u003e time()', is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by 'session_start()', based on 'session.gc_divisor', 'session.gc_probability' and 'session.gc_maxlifetime' settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
