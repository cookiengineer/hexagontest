	"name": "CVE-2024-43649",
	"description": "Authenticated command injection in the filename of a \u003credacted\u003e.exe request leads to remote code execution as the root user.This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.Likelihood: Moderate - This action is not a common place for command injection vulnerabilities to occur. Thus, an attacker will likely only be able to find this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the firmware or trying it on all \u003credacted\u003e fields. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the \u003credacted\u003e binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a payload.Impact: Critical - The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services.CVSS clarification: This attack can be performed over any network conenction serving the web interfacr (AV:N), and there are not additional mitigating measures that need to be circumvented (AC:L) or other prerequisites (AT:N). The attack does require privileges, but the level does not matter (PR:L), there is no user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leeds to a full compromised of the charger (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H) and a compromised charger can be used to \"pivot\" to networks that should normally not be reachable (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Because this is an EV chargers with significant pwoer, there is a potential safety imp0act (S:P). THis attack can be automated (AU:Y).",
