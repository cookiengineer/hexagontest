	"description": "CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting \u0026 creating wikis. Suppression of wiki requests does not work as intended, and always restricts visibility to those with the '(createwiki)' user right regardless of the settings one sets on a given wiki request. This may expose information to users who are not supposed to be able to access it.",
