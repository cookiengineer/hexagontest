	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrementEnsure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput().Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure thesuperblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping thewatched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before thewatched_objects decrement.This can lead to a UAF of something like sb-\u003es_fs_info in tmpfs, but theUAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanksto the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().Also, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't callfsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already beenfreed, which would cause a UAF read of sb-\u003es_fsnotify_info.",
