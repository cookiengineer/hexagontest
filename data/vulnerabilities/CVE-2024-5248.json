{
	"name": "CVE-2024-5248",
	"description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the 'GET /v1/users/me/org' endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the 'Prompt Editor' role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the 'Prompt Editor' role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls.",
