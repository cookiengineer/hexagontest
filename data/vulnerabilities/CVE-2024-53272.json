	"name": "CVE-2024-53272",
	"description": "Habitica is an open-source habit-building program. Versions prior to 5.28.5 are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. The 'login' and 'social media' function in 'RegisterLoginReset.vue' contains two reflected XSS vulnerabilities due to an incorrect sanitization function. An attacker can specify a malicious 'redirectTo' parameter to trigger the vulnerability, giving the attacker control of the victims account when a victim registers or logins with a specially crafted link. Version 5.28.5 contains a patch.",
