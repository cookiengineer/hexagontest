	"name": "CVE-2024-7456",
	"description": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the '/api/v1/external-users' route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The 'order by' clause of the SQL query uses 'sql.unsafe' without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The 'orderByClause' variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption.",
