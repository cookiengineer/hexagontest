{
	"name": "CVE-2024-31205",
	"description": "Saleor is an e-commerce platform. Starting in version 3.10.0 and prior to versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19, an attacker may bypass cross-set request forgery (CSRF) validation when calling refresh token mutation with empty string. When a user provides an empty string in 'refreshToken' mutation, while the token persists in 'JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME' cookie, application omits validation against CSRF token and returns valid access token. Versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may replace 'saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py.get_refresh_token'. This will fix the issue, but be aware, that it returns 'JWT_MISSING_TOKEN' instead of 'JWT_INVALID_TOKEN'.",
