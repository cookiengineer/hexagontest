{
	"name": "CVE-2024-3674",
	"description": "The Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'gdoc' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.13.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'chart_resolution'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
