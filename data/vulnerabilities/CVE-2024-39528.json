	"description": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).On all Junos OS and Junos Evolved platforms, if a routing-instance deactivation is triggered, and at the same time a specific SNMP request is received, a segmentation fault occurs which causes rpd to crash and restart.This issue affects:   Junos OS:  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,   *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S5,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3,  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S2,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2.   Junos OS Evolved:  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,  *  21.4-EVO versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO,  *  22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,   *  22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R3-S2-EVO,  *  22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R3-EVO,  *  23.2-EVO versions before 23.2R2-EVO.",
