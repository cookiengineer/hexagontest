	"name": "CVE-2024-6311",
	"description": "The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'af2_add_font' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
