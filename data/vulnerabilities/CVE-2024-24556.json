	"name": "CVE-2024-24556",
	"description": "urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.  The '@urql/next' package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit this an attacker would need to ensure that the response returns 'html' tags and that the web-application is using streamed responses (non-RSC).
