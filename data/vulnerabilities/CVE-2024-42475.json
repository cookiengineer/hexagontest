{
	"name": "CVE-2024-42475",
	"description": "In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the 'state' values generated by the 'generateState' function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with the attacker's protected resources. While 'state' isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. 'generateState' should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the 'generateState' function to generate 'state' values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.",
