{
	"name": "CVE-2024-1382",
	"description": "The Restaurant Reservations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.9 via the nd_rst_layout attribute of the nd_rst_search shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where an uploaded PHP file may not be directly accessible.",
