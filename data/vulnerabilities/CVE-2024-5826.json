{
	"name": "CVE-2024-5826",
	"description": "In the latest version of vanna-ai/vanna, the 'vanna.ask' function is vulnerable to remote code execution due to prompt injection. The root cause is the lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code, allowing an attacker to manipulate the code executed by the 'exec' function in 'src/vanna/base/base.py'. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the app backend server, potentially gaining full control of the server.",
