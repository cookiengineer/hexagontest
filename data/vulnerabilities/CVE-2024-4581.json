{
	"name": "CVE-2024-4581",
	"description": "The Slider Revolution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Add Layer widget in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user supplied 'class', 'id', and 'title' attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an Administrator to give Slider Creation privileges to Author-level users.",
