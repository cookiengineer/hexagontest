	"name": "CVE-2024-27094",
	"description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The 'Base64.encode' function encodes a 'bytes' input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 5.0.2 and 4.9.6.",
