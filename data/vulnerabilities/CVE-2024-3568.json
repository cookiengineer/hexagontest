{
	"name": "CVE-2024-3568",
	"description": "The huggingface/transformers library is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the 'load_repo_checkpoint()' function of the 'TFPreTrainedModel()' class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized payload, exploiting the use of 'pickle.load()' on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine.",
