{
	"name": "CVE-2024-41945",
	"description": "fuels-ts is a library for interacting with Fuel v2.  The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the 'fund' function in 'fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts' gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function 'getResourcesToSpend' without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the 'txpool' / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the 'txpool' and replaced with a new one.",
