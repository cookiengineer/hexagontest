	"name": "CVE-2024-45805",
	"description": "OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. Before 6.3.0, general users can access information that can only be accessed by users with access privileges to admin and support information (SETTINGS_SUPPORT). This is due to inadequate access control for support information (http://\u003copencti_domain\u003e/storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip), and that the UUID is available to general users using an attached query (logs query). This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.0.",
