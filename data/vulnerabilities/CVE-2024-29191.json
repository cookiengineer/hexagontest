	"description": "gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The links page ('links.html') appends the 'src' GET parameter ('[0]') in all of its links for 1-click previews. The context in which 'src' is being appended is 'innerHTML' ('[1]'), which will insert the text as HTML. Commit 3b3d5b033aac3a019af64f83dec84f70ed2c8aba contains a patch for the issue.",
