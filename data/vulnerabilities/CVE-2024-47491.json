	"name": "CVE-2024-47491",
	"description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).When a BGP UPDATE with malformed path attribute is received over an established BGP session, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices. While this issue affects systems running 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the probability of impact on 64-bit system is extremely low.
