	"name": "CVE-2024-47612",
	"description": "DataDump is a MediaWiki extension that provides dumps of wikis. Several interface messages are unescaped (more specifically, (datadump-table-column-queued), (datadump-table-column-in-progress), (datadump-table-column-completed), (datadump-table-column-failed)). If these messages are edited (which requires the (editinterface) right by default), anyone who can view Special:DataDump (which requires the (view-dump) right by default) can be XSSed. This vulnerability is fixed with 601688ee8e8808a23b102fa305b178f27cbd226d.",
