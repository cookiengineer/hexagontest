{
	"name": "CVE-2024-26149",
	"description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in '_abi_decode', it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations in contracts that use arrays within '_abi_decode'. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.",
