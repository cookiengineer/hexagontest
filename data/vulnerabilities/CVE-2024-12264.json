{
	"name": "CVE-2024-12264",
	"description": "The PayU CommercePro Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This is due to /wp-json/payu/v1/generate-user-token and /wp-json/payu/v1/get-shipping-cost  REST API endpoints not properly verifying a user's identity prior to setting the users ID and auth cookies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new administrative user accounts.",
