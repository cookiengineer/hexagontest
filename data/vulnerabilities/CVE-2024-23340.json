{
	"name": "CVE-2024-23340",
	"description": "@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with 'url' behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains '..', here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the 'url' in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so 'http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt' is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using 'serveStatic'. Modern web browsers and a latest 'curl' command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use 'serveStatic'.",
