	"name": "CVE-2024-34713",
	"description": "sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on the gateway to an internal host via SSH. Prior to version 1.6.3, any user authorized to connect to a ssh server using 'sshproxy' can inject options to the 'ssh' command executed by 'sshproxy'. All versions of 'sshproxy' are impacted. The problem is patched starting in version 1.6.3. The only workaround is to use the 'force_command' option in 'sshproxy.yaml', but it's rarely relevant.",
