	"name": "CVE-2024-36107",
	"description": "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. 'If-Modified-Since' and 'If-Unmodified-Since' headers when used with anonymous requests by sending a random object name requests can be used to determine if an object exists or not on the server on a specific bucket and also gain access to some amount ofinformation such as  'Last-Modified (of the latest version)', 'Etag (of the latest version)', 'x-amz-version-id (of the latest version)', 'Expires (metadata value of the latest version)', 'Cache-Control (metadata value of the latest version)'. This conditional check was being honored before validating if the anonymous access is indeed allowed on the metadata of an object. This issue has been addressed in commit 'e0fe7cc3917'. Users must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
