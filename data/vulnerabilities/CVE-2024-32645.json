	"name": "CVE-2024-32645",
	"description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, incorrect values can be logged when 'raw_log' builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics. A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The 'build_IR' function of the 'RawLog' class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics. As of time of publication, no fixed version is available.",
