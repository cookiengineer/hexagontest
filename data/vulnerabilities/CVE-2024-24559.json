{
	"name": "CVE-2024-24559",
	"description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an error in the stack management when compiling the 'IR' for 'sha3_64'. Concretely, the 'height' variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the 'IR' by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). 'sha3_64' is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the 'key' was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated 'IR'. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.",
