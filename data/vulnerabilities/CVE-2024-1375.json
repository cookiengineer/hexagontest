	"name": "CVE-2024-1375",
	"description": "The Event post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized bulk metadata update due to a missing nonce check on the save_bulkdatas function in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update post_meta_data via a forged request, granted they can trick a logged-in user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
