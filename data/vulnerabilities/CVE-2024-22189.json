{
	"name": "CVE-2024-22189",
	"description": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Prior to version 0.42.0, an attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of 'NEW_CONNECTION_ID' frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a 'RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID' frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these 'RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID' frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. Version 0.42.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.",
