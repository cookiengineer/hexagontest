	"name": "CVE-2024-56540",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery invocation during probe and resumeRefactor IPC send and receive functions to allow correcthandling of operations that should not trigger a recovery process.Expose ivpu_send_receive_internal(), which is now utilized by the D0i3entry, DCT initialization, and HWS initialization functions.These functions have been modified to return error codes gracefully,rather than initiating recovery.The updated functions are invoked within ivpu_probe() and ivpu_resume(),ensuring that any errors encountered during these stages result in a properteardown or shutdown sequence. The previous approach of triggering recoverywithin these functions could lead to a race condition, potentially causingundefined behavior and kernel crashes due to null pointer dereferences.",
