	"name": "CVE-2024-26755",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:md: Don't suspend the array for interrupted reshapemd_start_sync() will suspend the array if there are spares that can beadded or removed from conf, however, if reshape is still in progress,this won't happen at all or data will be corrupted(remove_and_add_spareswon't be called from md_choose_sync_action for reshape), hence there isno need to suspend the array if reshape is not done yet.Meanwhile, there is a potential deadlock for raid456:1) reshape is interrupted;2) set one of the disk WantReplacement, and add a new disk to the array,   however, recovery won't start until the reshape is finished;3) then issue an IO across reshpae position, this IO will wait for   reshape to make progress;4) continue to reshape, then md_start_sync() found there is a spare disk   that can be added to conf, mddev_suspend() is called;Step 4 and step 3 is waiting for each other, deadlock triggered. Notedthis problem is found by code review, and it's not reporduced yet.Fix this porblem by don't suspend the array for interrupted reshape,this is safe because conf won't be changed until reshape is done.",
