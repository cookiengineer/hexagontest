	"name": "CVE-2024-11777",
	"description": "The Sell Media plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'sell_media_search_form_gutenberg' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
