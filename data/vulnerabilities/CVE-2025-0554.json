	"description": "The Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Feed Name value in version \u003c= 4.1.25 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
