	"description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and NFX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).If an affected device receives specific valid traffic destined to the device, it will cause the PFE to crash and restart.  Continued receipt and processing of this traffic will create a sustained DoS condition.This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7.9,  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5.3,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4.11,  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3.This issue affects Junos OS on NFX Series:  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S8,  *  22.1 versions after 22.1R1,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S5,  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3.Junos OS versions prior to 21.4R1 are not affected by this issue.",
