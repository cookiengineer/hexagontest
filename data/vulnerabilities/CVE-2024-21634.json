	"name": "CVE-2024-21634",
	"description": "Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in 'ion-java' for applications that use 'ion-java' to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the 'IonValue' model and then invoke certain 'IonValue' methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the 'IonValue' model, results in a 'StackOverflowError' originating from the 'ion-java' library. The patch is included in 'ion-java' 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.",
