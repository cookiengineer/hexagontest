	"name": "CVE-2024-23656",
	"description": "Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex 2.37.0 serves HTTPS with insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. 'cmd/dex/serve.go' line 425 seemingly sets TLS 1.2 as minimum version, but the whole 'tlsConfig' is ignored after 'TLS cert reloader' was introduced in v2.37.0. Configured cipher suites are not respected either. This issue is fixed in Dex 2.38.0.",
