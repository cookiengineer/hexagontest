	"name": "CVE-2024-9462",
	"description": "The Poll Maker - Versus Polls, Anonymous Polls, Image Polls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via poll settings in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
