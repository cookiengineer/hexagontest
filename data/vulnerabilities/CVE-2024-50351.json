	"description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"section\" parameter of the \"logs\" tab of a device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious \"section\" parameter, potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises from a lack of sanitization in the \"report_this()\" function. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.",
