	"description": "The Form Maker by 10Web - Mobile-Friendly Drag \u0026 Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's display name autofilled into forms in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.24 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
