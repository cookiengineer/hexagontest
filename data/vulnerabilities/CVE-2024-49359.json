	"name": "CVE-2024-49359",
	"description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint 'http://\u003cZima_Server_IP:PORT\u003e/v2_1/file' in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as '/etc', potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",
