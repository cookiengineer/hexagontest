{
	"name": "CVE-2024-3152",
	"description": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the '/request-token', '/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update', '/system/remove-logo', '/system/logo', and collector's '/process' endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to 'prisma' functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0.",
