	"description": "Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the PasswordPusher application, affecting versions 'v1.41.1' through and including 'v.1.48.0'. The issue arises from an un-sanitized parameter which could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. Users who self-host and have the login system enabled are affected.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could expose user data, access to user sessions or take unintended actions on behalf of users. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to click a malicious account confirmation link. It is highly recommended to update to version 'v1.48.1' or later to mitigate this risk. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.### SolutionUpdate to version 'v1.48.1' or later where input sanitization has been applied to the account confirmation process.  If updating is not immediately possible,",
