{
	"name": "CVE-2024-6867",
	"description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the 'runs/{run_id}/related' endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the 'run_id' listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the 'run_id' of a public or non-public run.",
