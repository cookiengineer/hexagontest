	"name": "CVE-2024-7700",
	"description": "A command injection flaw was found in the \"Host Init Config\" template in the Foreman application via the \"Install Packages\" field on the \"Register Host\" page. This flaw allows an attacker with the necessary privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the configuration, potentially allowing unauthorized command execution during host registration. Although this issue requires user interaction to execute injected commands, it poses a significant risk if an unsuspecting user runs the generated registration script.",
