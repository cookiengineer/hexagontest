	"description": "PTZOptics PT30X-SDI/NDI-xx before firmware 6.3.40 is vulnerable to an OS command injection issue. The camera does not sufficiently validate the ntp_addr configuration value which may lead to arbitrary command execution when ntp_client is started. When chained with CVE-2024-8956, a remote and unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on affected devices.",
