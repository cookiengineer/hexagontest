	"description": "An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).An attacker can send specific traffic to the device, which causes the rpd to crash and restart. Continued receipt of this traffic will result in a sustained DoS condition.This issue only affects devices with an EVPN-VPWS instance with IGMP-snooping enabled.This issue affects Junos OS:   *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,   *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2;Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10-EVO,   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S6-EVO,   *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S2-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
