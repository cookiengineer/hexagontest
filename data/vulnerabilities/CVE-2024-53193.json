	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_providerSome heap space is allocated for the flexible structure 'structclk_hw_onecell_data' and its flexible-array member 'hws' throughthe composite structure 'struct loongson2_clk_provider' in function'loongson2_clk_probe()', as shown below:289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;    ...296         for (p = data; p-\u003ename; p++)297                 clks_num++;298299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num),300                            GFP_KERNEL);Then some data is written into the flexible array:350                 clp-\u003eclk_data.hws[p-\u003eid] = hw;This corrupts 'clk_lock', which is the spinlock variable immediatelyfollowing the 'clk_data' member in 'struct loongson2_clk_provider':struct loongson2_clk_provider {    void __iomem *base;    struct device *dev;    struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;    spinlock_t clk_lock;    /* protect access to DIV registers */};The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in themiddle of 'struct loongson2_clk_provider' instead of at the end.Fix this by moving 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;' to the end of'struct loongson2_clk_provider'. Also, add a code comment to helpprevent this from happening again in case new members are added to thestructure in the future.This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-endwarning:drivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c:32:36: warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]",
