	"description": "IrfanView PIC File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PIC files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write before the start of an allocated buffer.
