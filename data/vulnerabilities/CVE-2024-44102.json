	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in PP TeleControl Server Basic 1000 to 5000 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AE1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), PP TeleControl Server Basic 256 to 1000 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AD1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), PP TeleControl Server Basic 32 to 64 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AF1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), PP TeleControl Server Basic 64 to 256 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AC1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), PP TeleControl Server Basic 8 to 32 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AB1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 1000 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AD0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 256 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AC0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 32 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AF0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 5000 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AE0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 64 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AB0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic 8 V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0AA0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic Serv Upgr (6NH9910-0AA31-0GA1) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured), TeleControl Server Basic Upgr V3.1 (6NH9910-0AA31-0GA0) (All versions \u003c V3.1.2.1 with redundancy configured). The affected system allows remote users to send maliciously crafted objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with SYSTEM privileges.",
