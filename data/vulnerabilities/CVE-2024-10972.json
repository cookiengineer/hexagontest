	"name": "CVE-2024-10972",
	"description": "Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSOD with a parallel thread changing the memorys access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing the userspace to change page permissions half way through the routine.  A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.",
