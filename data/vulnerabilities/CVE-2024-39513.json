	"name": "CVE-2024-39513",
	"description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).When a specific \"clear\" command is run, the Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt or evo-aftmand-zx) crashes and restarts.The crash impacts all traffic going through the FPCs, causing a DoS. Running the command repeatedly leads to a sustained DoS condition.This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 20.4R3-S9-EVO,   *  from 21.2-EVO before 21.2R3-S7-EVO,   *  from 21.3-EVO before 21.3R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S6-EVO,   *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
