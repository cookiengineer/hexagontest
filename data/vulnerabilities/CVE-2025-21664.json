	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first functionThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -\u003elist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of thesefunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can leadto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but thesubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after amodification.In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GPfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid listhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that andturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since thelist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which thisoccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, anda UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,prior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, itwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr'ssynchronize_rcu.The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thinslist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at justthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a singleREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.This was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioningsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",
