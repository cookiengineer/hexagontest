{
	"name": "CVE-2024-38358",
	"description": "Wasmer is a web assembly (wasm) Runtime supporting WASIX, WASI and Emscripten. If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both 'oflags::creat' and 'rights::fd_write'. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink pointing outside with 'path_symlink' and 'path_open'ing the link. This issue has been addressed in commit 'b9483d022' which has been included in release version 4.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
