	"name": "CVE-2024-12293",
	"description": "The User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.64.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_roles() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove roles for arbitrary users, including escalating their privileges to administrator, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
