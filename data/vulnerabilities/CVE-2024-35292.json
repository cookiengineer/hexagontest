	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU CR40 (6ES7288-1CR40-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU CR60 (6ES7288-1CR60-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR20 (6ES7288-1SR20-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR20 (6ES7288-1SR20-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR30 (6ES7288-1SR30-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR30 (6ES7288-1SR30-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR40 (6ES7288-1SR40-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR40 (6ES7288-1SR40-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR60 (6ES7288-1SR60-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU SR60 (6ES7288-1SR60-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST20 (6ES7288-1ST20-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST20 (6ES7288-1ST20-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST30 (6ES7288-1ST30-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST30 (6ES7288-1ST30-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST40 (6ES7288-1ST40-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST40 (6ES7288-1ST40-0AA1) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST60 (6ES7288-1ST60-0AA0) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU ST60 (6ES7288-1ST60-0AA1) (All versions). Affected devices are using a predictable IP ID sequence number. This leaves the system susceptible to a family of attacks which rely on the use of predictable IP ID sequence numbers as their base method of attack and eventually could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition.",
