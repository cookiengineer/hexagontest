	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereferenceThis patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function iscalled from request_lock() as lkb-\u003elkb_resource is not assigned yet,only after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb(). Another issueis that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannotassume to be ASCII coded.The log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used innormal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereferencecan only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resourceassigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but weshould be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and weactually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.In this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb idis enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if thisexists.",
