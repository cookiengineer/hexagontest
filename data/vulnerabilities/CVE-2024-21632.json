{
	"name": "CVE-2024-21632",
	"description": "omniauth-microsoft_graph provides an Omniauth strategy for the Microsoft Graph API. Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the 'email' attribute of the user nor did it give/document an option to do so, making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the 'email' is used as a trusted user identifier. This could lead to account takeover. Version 2.0.0 contains a fix for this issue.",
