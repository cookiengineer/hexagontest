	"name": "CVE-2024-32646",
	"description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the 'slice' builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either 'msg.data', 'self.code' or '\u003caddress\u003e.code' and either the 'start' or 'length' arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions '\u003c0.3.4' as '0.3.4' introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.",
