{
	"name": "CVE-2024-9177",
	"description": "The Themedy Toolbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's themedy_col, themedy_social_link, themedy_alertbox, and themedy_pullleft shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14, and up to, and including 1.0.15 for the plugin's themedy_button shortcode due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
