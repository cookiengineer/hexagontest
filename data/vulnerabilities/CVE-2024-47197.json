	"description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin.This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.Archetype integration testing creates a filecalled ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xmlThis file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also containscredentials.When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part ofthe final artifact.If a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a releaseor a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.",
