{
	"name": "CVE-2024-27931",
	"description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Insufficient validation of parameters in 'Deno.makeTemp*' APIs would allow for creation of files outside of the allowed directories. This may allow the user to overwrite important files on the system that may affect other systems. A user may provide a prefix or suffix to a 'Deno.makeTemp*' API containing path traversal characters. This is fixed in Deno 1.41.1.",
