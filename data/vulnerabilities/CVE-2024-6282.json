	"name": "CVE-2024-6282",
	"description": "The Master Addons - Free Widgets, Hover Effects, Toggle, Conditions, Animations for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the data-jltma-wrapper-link element in all versions up to, and including 2.0.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user clicks on the injected link.",
