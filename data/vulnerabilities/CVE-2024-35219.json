	"name": "CVE-2024-35219",
	"description": "OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Prior to version 7.6.0, attackers can exploit a path traversal vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the 'outputFolder' option. The issue was fixed in version 7.6.0 by removing the usage of the 'outputFolder' option. No known workarounds are available.",
