	"description": "An issue in KIA Seltos vehicle instrument cluster with software and hardware v1.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via ECU reset UDS service. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the findings came from a potentially unrealistic test environment (an isolated ECU part that was not in a vehicle), and because the ECUReset specification does not allow a manufacturer to require SecurityAccess and Authentication.",
