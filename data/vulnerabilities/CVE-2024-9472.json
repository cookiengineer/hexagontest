	"description": "A null pointer dereference in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode.Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected.This issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS:  *  10.2.7-h12  *  10.2.8-h10  *  10.2.9-h9  *  10.2.9-h11  *  10.2.10-h2  *  10.2.10-h3  *  10.2.11  *  10.2.11-h1  *  10.2.11-h2  *  10.2.11-h3  *  11.1.2-h9  *  11.1.2-h12  *  11.1.3-h2  *  11.1.3-h4  *  11.1.3-h6  *  11.2.2  *  11.2.2-h1",
