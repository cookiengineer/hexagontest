	"name": "CVE-2024-30254",
	"description": "MesonLSP is an unofficial, unendorsed language server for meson written in C++. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.4 allows overwriting arbitrary files if the attacker can make the victim either run the language server within a specific crafted project or 'mesonlsp --full'. Version 4.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid running 'mesonlsp --full' and set the language server option 'others.neverDownloadAutomatically' to 'true'.",
