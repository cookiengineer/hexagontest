	"name": "CVE-2024-21636",
	"description": "view_component is a framework for building reusable, testable, and encapsulated view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a '#call' method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the '#call' method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the '#output_postamble' methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the '#call' and the '#output_postamble' vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of '#call'.",
