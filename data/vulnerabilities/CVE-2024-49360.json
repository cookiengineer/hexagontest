	"name": "CVE-2024-49360",
	"description": "Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders 'C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx'. An authenticated attacker who can use 'explorer.exe' or 'cmd.exe' outside any sandbox can read other users' files in 'C:\\Sandbox\\xxx'. By default in Windows 7+, the 'C:\\Users\\UserA' folder is not readable by **UserB**.All files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If 'UserB' runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access 'C:\\Sandox\\UserA'. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder 'C:\\Sandbox\\UserA' with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie.",
