{
	"name": "CVE-2024-31455",
	"description": "Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring in commit '5c381cf' added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to '5c381cf', or roll forward past '2eb94e7'.",
