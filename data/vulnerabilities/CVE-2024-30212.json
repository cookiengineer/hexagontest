	"description": "If a SCSI READ(10) command is initiated via USB using the largest LBA (0xFFFFFFFF) with it's default block size of 512 and a count of 1,the first 512 byte of the 0x80000000 memory area is returned to the user. If the block count is increased, the full RAM can be exposed.The same method works to write to this memory area. If RAM contains pointers, those can be - depending on the application - overwritten toreturn data from any other offset including Progam and Boot Flash.",
