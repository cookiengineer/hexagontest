	"name": "CVE-2024-40893",
	"description": "Multiple authenticated operating system (OS) command injection vulnerabilities exist in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. A physically close attacker that is authenticated to the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface can use the network configuration service to inject commands in various configuration parameters including networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.PingTestIP, networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.DNSTestDomain, and networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Gateway6. Additionally, because the configuration can be synced to the Firewalla cloud, the attacker may be able to persist access even after hardware resets and firmware re-flashes.",
