{
	"name": "CVE-2024-32468",
	"description": "Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript written in rust. Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the 'deno_doc' crate which lead to Self-XSS with deno doc --html. 1.) XSS in generated 'search_index.js', 'deno_doc' outputs a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used 'innerHTML' on unsanitzed HTML input. 2.) XSS via property, method and enum names, 'deno_doc' did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names. The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since 'deno doc --html' is expected to be used locally with own packages.",
