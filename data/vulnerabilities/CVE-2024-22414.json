	"name": "CVE-2024-22414",
	"description": "flaskBlog is a simple blog app built with Flask. Improper storage and rendering of the '/user/\u003cuser\u003e' page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code. The html template 'user.html' contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: '\u003cdiv class=\"content\" tag=\"content\"\u003e{{comment[2]|safe}}\u003c/div\u003e'. Use of the \"safe\" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the '|safe' tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation.",
