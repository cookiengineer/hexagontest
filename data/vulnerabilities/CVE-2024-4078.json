{
	"name": "CVE-2024-4078",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms, specifically in the '/unInstall_binding' endpoint, allows for arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of user input. The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the 'name' parameter in the 'unInstall_binding' function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious '__init__.py' file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed.",
