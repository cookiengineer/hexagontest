{
	"name": "CVE-2024-52802",
	"description": "RIOT is an operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In version 2024.04 and prior, the function '_parse_advertise', located in '/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c', has no minimum header length check for 'dhcpv6_opt_t' after processing 'dhcpv6_msg_t'. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function '_preparse_advertise', which is called by '_parse_advertise' before handling the request. As of time of publication, no known patched version exists.",
