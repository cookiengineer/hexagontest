	"name": "CVE-2024-39525",
	"description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specific BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects systems with BGP traceoptions enabled and requires a BGP session to be already established.  Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not affected by this issue.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
