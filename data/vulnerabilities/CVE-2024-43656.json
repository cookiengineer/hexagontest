	"name": "CVE-2024-43656",
	"description": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability allows OS Command Injection as rootThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers before version 24120701.Likelihood: Moderate - It might be difficult for an attacker to identify the file structure of the \u003credated\u003e directory, and then modify the backup to add a new CGI script in the correct directory. Furthermore, the attacker will need an account to restore the settings backup, or convince a user with such access to upload a modified backup file.Impact: Critical - The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and deletefiles and services.CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L), nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H), and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).",
