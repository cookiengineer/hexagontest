	"name": "CVE-2024-45311",
	"description": "Quinn is a pure-Rust, async-compatible implementation of the IETF QUIC transport protocol. As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to 'accept()', 'retry()', 'refuse()', or 'ignore()' an 'Incoming' connection. However, calling 'retry()' on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling 'refuse' or 'ignore' on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's 'refuse()'/'ignore()' code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.",
