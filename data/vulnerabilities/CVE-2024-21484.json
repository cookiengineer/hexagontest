	"name": "CVE-2024-21484",
	"description": "Versions of the package jsrsasign before 11.0.0 are vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy via the RSA PKCS1.5 or RSAOAEP decryption process.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key. Workaround The vulnerability can be mitigated by finding and replacing RSA and RSAOAEP decryption with another crypto library.",
