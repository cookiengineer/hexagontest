	"name": "CVE-2024-4888",
	"description": "BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to improper input validation on the '/audio/transcriptions' endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that includes a file path to the server, which then deletes the specified file without proper authorization or validation. This vulnerability is present in the code where 'os.remove(file.filename)' is used to delete a file, allowing any user to delete critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, or configuration files.",
