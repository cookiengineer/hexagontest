	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedgingIf GuC fails to load, the driver wedges, but in the process it tries todo stuff that may not be initialized yet. This moves thexe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier: as its own doc says,it's a software-only initialization and should had been named with the_early() suffix.Move it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno areinitialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging:    xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: load failed: status: Reset = 0, BootROM = 0x50, UKernel = 0x00, MIA = 0x00, Auth = 0x01    xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: firmware signature verification failed    xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* CRITICAL: Xe has declared device 0000:03:00.0 as wedged.    ...
