	"description": "The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment \u0026 job listings | WooCommerce CRM \u0026 Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter via the erp/v1/accounting/v1/vendors/1/products/ REST route in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin or accounting manager privileges, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
