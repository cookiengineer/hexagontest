	"name": "CVE-2024-42457",
	"description": "A vulnerability in Veeam Backup \u0026 Replication allows users with certain operator roles to expose saved credentials by leveraging a combination of methods in a remote management interface. This can be achieved using a session object that allows for credential enumeration and exploitation, leading to the leak of plaintext credentials to a malicious host. The attack is facilitated by improper usage of a method that allows operators to add a new host with an attacker-controlled IP, enabling them to retrieve sensitive credentials in plaintext.",
