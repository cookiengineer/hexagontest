{
	"name": "CVE-2024-54151",
	"description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting 'WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH' or 'WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH' to \"public\", an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either 'WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH' or 'WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH' set to 'public' allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.",
