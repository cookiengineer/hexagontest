{
	"name": "CVE-2024-11705",
	"description": "'NSC_DeriveKey' inadvertently assumed that the 'phKey' parameter is always non-NULL. When it was passed as NULL, a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurred, leading to crashes. This behavior conflicted with the PKCS#11 v3.0 specification, which allows 'phKey' to be NULL for certain mechanisms. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 133 and Thunderbird \u003c 133.",
