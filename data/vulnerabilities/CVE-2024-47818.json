A logged-in user with any role can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem by calling the 'sync/clean_sync_dir' endpoint. The 'dir_name' POST parameter is not validated/sanitized and is used to construct the 'syncDir' that is deleted by calling 'fs.rm'. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.0.0-beta16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
