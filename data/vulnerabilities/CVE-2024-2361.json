{
	"name": "CVE-2024-2361",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui allows for arbitrary file upload and read due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the issue resides in the 'install_model()' function within 'lollms_core/lollms/binding.py', where the application fails to properly sanitize the 'file://' protocol and other inputs, leading to arbitrary read and upload capabilities. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'path' and 'variant_name' parameters to achieve path traversal, allowing for the reading of arbitrary files and uploading files to arbitrary locations on the server. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.",
