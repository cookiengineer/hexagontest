{
	"name": "CVE-2024-1560",
	"description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path validation by exploiting the double decoding process in the '_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts' handler and 'local_file_uri_to_path' function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem. This vulnerability is due to an extra unquote operation in the 'delete_artifacts' function of 'local_artifact_repo.py', which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version 2.9.2, despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831.",
