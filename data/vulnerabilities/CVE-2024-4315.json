{
	"name": "CVE-2024-4315",
	"description": "parisneo/lollms version 9.5 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks due to insufficient path sanitization. The 'sanitize_path_from_endpoint' function fails to properly sanitize Windows-style paths (backward slash '\\'), allowing attackers to perform directory traversal attacks on Windows systems. This vulnerability can be exploited through various routes, including 'personalities' and '/del_preset', to read or delete any file on the Windows filesystem, compromising the system's availability.",
