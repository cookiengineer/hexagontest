{
	"name": "CVE-2024-23745",
	"description": "In Notion Web Clipper 1.0.3(7), a .nib file is susceptible to the Dirty NIB attack. NIB files can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, even if a NIB file is modified within an application, Gatekeeper may still permit the execution of the application, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands within the application's context. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is simply an instance of CVE-2022-48505, cannot properly be categorized as a product-level vulnerability, and cannot have a product-level fix because it is about incorrect caching of file signatures on macOS.",
