{
	"name": "CVE-2024-29187",
	"description": "WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. When a bundle runs as SYSTEM user, Burn uses GetTempPathW which points to an insecure directory C:\\Windows\\Temp to drop and load multiple binaries. Standard users can hijack the binary before it's loaded in the application resulting in elevation of privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.",
