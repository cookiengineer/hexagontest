{
	"name": "CVE-2024-31995",
	"description": "'@digitalbazaar/zcap' provides JavaScript reference implementation for Authorization Capabilities. Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the 'expires' property is not properly checked against the current date or other 'date' param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. '@digitalbazaar/zcap' v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time.",
