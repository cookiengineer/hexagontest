{
	"name": "CVE-2024-22417",
	"description": "Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3 and prior, the 'element' method in 'app/routes.py' does not validate the user-controlled 'src_type' and 'element_url' variables and passes them to the 'send' method which sends a 'GET' request on lines 339-343 in 'requests.py'. The returned contents of the URL are then passed to and reflected back to the user in the 'send_file' function on line 484, together with the user-controlled 'src_type', which allows the attacker to control the HTTP response content type leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link. The malicious website could, for example, be a copy of a real website, meant to steal a persons credentials to the website, or trick that person in another way. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for this issue.",
