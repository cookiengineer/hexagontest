	"name": "CVE-2024-39556",
	"description": "A Stack-Based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI the ability to load a malicious certificate file, leading to a limited Denial of Service (DoS) or privileged code execution.By exploiting the 'set security certificates' command with a crafted certificate file, a malicious attacker with access to the CLI could cause a crash of the command management daemon (mgd), limited to the local user's command interpreter, or potentially trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.This issue affects: Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7,   *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S6,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S1, 23.4R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO,   *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S6-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
