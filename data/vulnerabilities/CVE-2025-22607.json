	"name": "CVE-2025-22607",
	"description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to fetch the details page for any GitHub / GitLab configuration on a Coolify instance by only knowing the UUID of the model. This exposes the \"client id\", \"client secret\" and \"webhook secret.\" Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes this issue.",
