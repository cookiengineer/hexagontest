{
	"name": "CVE-2024-32884",
	"description": "gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. 'gix-transport' does not check the username part of a URL for text that the external 'ssh' program would interpret as an option. A specially crafted clone URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs. This is related to the patched vulnerability GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34, but appears less severe due to a greater attack complexity. This issue has been patched in versions 0.35.0, 0.42.0 and 0.62.0.",
