{
	"name": "CVE-2024-4287",
	"description": "In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to '/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update', allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts.",
