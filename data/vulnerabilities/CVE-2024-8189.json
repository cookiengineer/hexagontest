	"name": "CVE-2024-8189",
	"description": "The WP MultiTasking - WP Utilities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the wpmt_menu_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.17 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
