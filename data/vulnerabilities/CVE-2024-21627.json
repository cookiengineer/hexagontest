{
	"name": "CVE-2024-21627",
	"description": "PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the 'isCleanHTML' method. Some modules using the 'isCleanHTML' method could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use the 'HTMLPurifier' library to sanitize html input coming from users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of 'HTML' type will call 'isCleanHTML'.",
