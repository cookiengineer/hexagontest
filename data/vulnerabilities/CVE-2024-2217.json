	"description": "gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to the 'config.json' file. This vulnerability is present in both authenticated and unauthenticated versions of the application, enabling attackers to obtain sensitive information such as API keys ('openai_api_key', 'google_palm_api_key', 'xmchat_api_key', etc.), configuration details, and user credentials. The issue stems from the application's handling of HTTP requests for the 'config.json' file, which does not properly restrict access based on user authentication.",
