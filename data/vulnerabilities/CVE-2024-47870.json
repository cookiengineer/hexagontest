{
	"name": "CVE-2024-47870",
	"description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the 'update_root_in_config' function, allowing an attacker to modify the 'root' URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to 'gradio\u003e=5' to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
