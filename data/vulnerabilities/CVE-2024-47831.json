{
	"name": "CVE-2024-47831",
	"description": "Next.js is a React Framework for the Web. Cersions on the 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, and 14.x branches before version 14.2.7 contain a vulnerability in the image optimization feature which allows for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition which could lead to excessive CPU consumption. Neither the 'next.config.js' file that is configured with 'images.unoptimized' set to 'true' or 'images.loader' set to a non-default value nor the Next.js application that is hosted on Vercel are affected. This issue was fully patched in Next.js '14.2.7'. As a workaround, ensure that the 'next.config.js' file has either 'images.unoptimized', 'images.loader' or 'images.loaderFile' assigned.",
