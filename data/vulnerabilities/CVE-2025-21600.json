	"name": "CVE-2025-21600",
	"description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability inthe routing protocol daemon (rpd) of  Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, logically adjacent BGP peer sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects systems configured in      either of two ways:                *  systems with BGP traceoptions enabled        *  systems with BGP family traffic-engineering (BGP-LS)          configured and can be exploited from a directly connected and configured BGP peer. This issue affects iBGP and eBGP with any address family configured, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S2-EVO,   *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.This issue does not affect versions of Junos OS prior to 21.3R1.This issue does not affect versions of Junos OS Evolved prior to 21.3R1-EVO.This is a similar, but different vulnerability than the issue reported as CVE-2024-39516.",
