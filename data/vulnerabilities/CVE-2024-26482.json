	"description": "An HTML injection vulnerability exists in the Edit Content Layout module of Kirby CMS v4.1.0. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report because some HTML formatting (such as with an H1 element) is allowed, but there is backend sanitization such that the reporter's mentioned \"injecting malicious scripts\" would not occur.",
