{
	"name": "CVE-2024-9264",
	"description": "The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of 'duckdb' queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to 'duckdb', leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The 'duckdb' binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.",
