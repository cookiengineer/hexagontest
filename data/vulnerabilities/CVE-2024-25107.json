{
	"name": "CVE-2024-25107",
	"description": "WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. On Special:WikiDiscover, the 'Language::date' function is used when making the human-readable timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It uses the '-\u003etext()' output mode, returning unescaped interface messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the '(editinterface)' right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit '267e763a0'. Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
