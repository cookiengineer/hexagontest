	"description": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. A SQL Injection vulnerability was found prior to the 2.9 branch in the 'ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php' file, which creates the query by concatenating the unsanitized GET parameter 'cod_func', allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as emails and password hashes. Commit 7824b95745fa2da6476b9901041d9c854bf52ffe fixes the issue.",
