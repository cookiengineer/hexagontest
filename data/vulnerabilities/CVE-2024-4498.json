	"name": "CVE-2024-4498",
	"description": "A Path Traversal and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application, affecting versions v9.7 to the latest. The vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation in the '/apply_settings' function, allowing an attacker to manipulate the 'discussion_db_name' parameter to traverse the file system and include arbitrary files. This issue is compounded by the bypass of input filtering in the 'install_binding', 'reinstall_binding', and 'unInstall_binding' endpoints, despite the presence of a 'sanitize_path_from_endpoint(data.name)' filter. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload and execute malicious code on the victim's system, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
