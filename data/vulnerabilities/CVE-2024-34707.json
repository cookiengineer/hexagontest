{
	"name": "CVE-2024-34707",
	"description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the 'BANNER_TOP', 'BANNER_BOTTOM', and 'BANNER_LOGIN' configuration settings via the '/admin/constance/config/' endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of 'BANNER_LOGIN') but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.",
