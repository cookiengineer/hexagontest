	"name": "CVE-2024-32463",
	"description": "phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. The filter to detect and prevent the use of the 'javascript:' URL scheme in the 'href' attribute of an '\u003ca\u003e' tag could be bypassed with tab '\\t' or newline '\\n' characters between the characters of the protocol, e.g. 'java\\tscript:'. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1, 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.7.2, 1.6.3, 1.5.3, and 1.4.2. Configuring a Content Security Policy that does not allow 'unsafe-inline' would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.",
