	"description": "stitionai/devika main branch as of commit cdfb782b0e634b773b10963c8034dc9207ba1f9f is vulnerable to Local File Read (LFI) by Prompt Injection. The integration of Google Gimini 1.0 Pro with 'HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE' for 'HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH' and 'HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT' in 'safety_settings' disables content protection. This allows malicious commands to be executed, such as reading sensitive file contents like '/etc/passwd'.",
