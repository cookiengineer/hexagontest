{
	"name": "CVE-2024-6971",
	"description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically in the 'lollms_file_system.py' file. The functions 'add_rag_database', 'toggle_mount_rag_database', and 'vectorize_folder' do not implement security measures such as 'sanitize_path_from_endpoint' or 'sanitize_path'. This allows an attacker to perform vectorize operations on '.sqlite' files in any directory on the victim's computer, potentially installing multiple packages and causing a crash.",
