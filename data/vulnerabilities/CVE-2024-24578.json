	"name": "CVE-2024-24578",
	"description": "RaspberryMatic is an open-source operating system for HomeMatic internet-of-things devices. RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based 'HMIPServer.jar' component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based 'HMIPServer', that can be accessed through URLs starting with '/pages/jpages'. The 'FirmwareController' class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.",
