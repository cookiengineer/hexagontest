{
	"name": "CVE-2024-32466",
	"description": "Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. For the '/v2/projects/translations' and '/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations' endpoints, translation data was returned even when API key was missing 'translation.view' scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by users permitted to 'translation.view'. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2",
