	"description": "The Responsive Lightbox \u0026 Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping affecting the rl_upload_image AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the 3gp2 file.",
