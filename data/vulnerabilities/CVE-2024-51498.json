	"description": "cobalt is a media downloader that doesn't piss you off. A malicious cobalt instance could serve links with the 'javascript:' protocol, resulting in Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the user tries to download an item from a picker. This issue has been present since commit '66bac03e', was mitigated in commit '97977efa' (correctly configured web instances were no longer vulnerable) and fully fixed in commit 'c4be1d3a' (included in release version 10.2.1). Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should enable a content-security-policy.",
