{
	"name": "CVE-2024-45053",
	"description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.44.0, the Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection that grants Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers to an Admin UI user with the default 'Owner' or 'Contributor' role, who can escalate their access and execute code on the underlying Fides Webserver container where the Jinja template rendering function is executed. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version '2.44.0'. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no workarounds.",
