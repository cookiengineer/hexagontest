{
	"name": "CVE-2024-45723",
	"description": "The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords for sharing cryptographic keys. The random function in use makes it easier for attackers to brute force this password if the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the optional broadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the key with local QR code for higher security operations.",
