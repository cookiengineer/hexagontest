{
	"name": "CVE-2024-5459",
	"description": "The Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized creation of data due to a missing capability check on 'add_section', 'add_menu', 'add_menu_item', and 'add_menu_page' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create menu sections, menus, food items, and new menu pages.",
