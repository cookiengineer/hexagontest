{
	"name": "CVE-2024-47871",
	"description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client and server when Gradio's 'share=True' option is used. HTTPS is not enforced on the connection, allowing attackers to intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos publicly over the internet using 'share=True' without proper encryption, exposing sensitive data to potential eavesdroppers. Users are advised to upgrade to 'gradio\u003e=5' to address this issue. As a workaround, users can avoid using 'share=True' in production environments and instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure communication.",
