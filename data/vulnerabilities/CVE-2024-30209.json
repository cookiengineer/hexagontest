	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA00) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA10) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA20) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA30) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA10) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA20) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA30) (All versions \u003c V3.0.1.1). Affected systems transmit client-side resources without proper cryptographic protection. This could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on and modify resources in transit. A successful exploit requires an attacker to be in the network path between the RTLS Locating Manager server and a client (MitM).",
