	"name": "CVE-2024-39516",
	"description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability inthe routing protocol daemon (rpd) of  Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects systems configured in      either of two ways:                *  systems with BGP traceoptions enabled        *  systems with BGP traffic engineering          configured    This issue can affect iBGP and eBGP with any address family configured. The specific attribute involved is non-transitive, and will not propagate across a network.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,   *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,   *  22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,   *  23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,   *  23.4 before 23.4R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,   *  22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,   *  22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO,   *  23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
