	"description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).In an EVPN/VXLAN scenario, when a high amount specific Layer 2 packets are processed by the device, it can cause the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) to utilize all CPU resources which causes the device to hang. A manual restart of the rpd is required to restore services.This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.This issue affectsJunos OS:All versions earlier than 21.4R3-S7;22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5;22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S3;22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3-S2;23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R2;23.4 versions earlier than 23.4R1-S1.Junos OS Evolved:All versions earlier than 21.4R3-S7-EVO;22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5-EVO;22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO;22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R3-S3-EVO;22.4-EVO versions earlier than 22.4R3-S2-EVO;23.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R2-EVO;23.4-EVO versions earlier than 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
