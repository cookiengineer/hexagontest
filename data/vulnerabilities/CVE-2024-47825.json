	"description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.16 and 1.15.10, a policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than '/32' may be ignored if there is a policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix ('CIDRSet' or 'toFQDN') and this narrower policy rule specifies either 'enableDefaultDeny: false' or '- toEntities: all'. Note that a rule specifying 'toEntities: world' or 'toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0' is insufficient, it must be to entity 'all'.This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using 'enableDefaultDeny: false' or that set 'toEntities' to 'all', some workarounds are available. For users with policies using 'enableDefaultDeny: false', remove this configuration option and explicitly define any allow rules required. For users with egress policies that explicitly specify 'toEntities: all', use 'toEntities: world'.",
