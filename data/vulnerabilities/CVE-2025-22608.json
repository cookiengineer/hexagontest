	"description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to revoke any team invitations on a Coolify instance by only providing a predictable and incrementing ID, resulting in a Denial-of-Service attack (DOS). Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes the issue.",
