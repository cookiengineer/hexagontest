	"name": "CVE-2024-45489",
	"description": "Arc before 2024-08-26 allows remote code execution in JavaScript boosts. Boosts that run JavaScript cannot be shared by default; however (because of misconfigured Firebase ACLs), it is possible to create or update a boost using another user's ID. This installs the boost in the victim's browser and runs arbitrary Javascript on that browser in a privileged context. NOTE: this is a no-action cloud vulnerability with zero affected users.",
