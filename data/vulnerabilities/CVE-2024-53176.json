	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:smb: During unmount, ensure all cached dir instances drop their dentryThe unmount process (cifs_kill_sb() calling close_all_cached_dirs()) canrace with various cached directory operations, which ultimately resultsin dentries not being dropped and these kernel BUGs:BUG: Dentry ffff88814f37e358{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of cifs (cifs)------------[ cut here ]------------kernel BUG at fs/super.c:661!This happens when a cfid is in the process of being cleaned up when, andhas been removed from the cfids-\u003eentries list, including:- Receiving a lease break from the server- Server reconnection triggers invalidate_all_cached_dirs(), which  removes all the cfids from the list- The laundromat thread decides to expire an old cfid.To solve these problems, dropping the dentry is done in queued work donein a newly-added cfid_put_wq workqueue, and close_all_cached_dirs()flushes that workqueue after it drops all the dentries of which it'saware. This is a global workqueue (rather than scoped to a mount), butthe queued work is minimal.The final cleanup work for cleaning up a cfid is performed via workqueued in the serverclose_wq workqueue; this is done separate fromdropping the dentries so that close_all_cached_dirs() doesn't block onany server operations.Both of these queued works expect to invoked with a cfid reference anda tcon reference to avoid those objects from being freed while the workis ongoing.While we're here, add proper locking to close_all_cached_dirs(), andlocking around the freeing of cfid-\u003edentry.",
