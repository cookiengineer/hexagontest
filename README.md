# Cyber Battlemap

This project aims to make cyber intelligence and cyber defense more approachable
as a live battlemap so that both the Blueteam and Redteam side can interact with
more measurable live data and interaction with the conquered systems.


## Assumptions

- Cyber Defense on the Blueteam side is only reactionary
- Cyber Defense on the Redteam side is inefficient due to varying degrees of scan results
- Alerts will just flood the users and make things harder and not easier
- Both sides have a data gathering and data correlation problem
- Dashboards should ease up correlation of results
- Dashboards should represent the live state of networks and systems

## Opinions

- Live inspection of systems must be possible at all times
- Live inspection of attack paths must be possible at all times
- Results must have a confidence factor to represent (un-)reliable results
- Intel/Recon/Conquer/Persistance phases should be represented with attack paths
- Attack Paths should reflect both likeliness and feasibility
